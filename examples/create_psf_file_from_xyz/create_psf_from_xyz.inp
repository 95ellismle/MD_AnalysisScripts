# create a psf file from an xyz file.   #
#                                       #
# The bonding information will be       #
# estimated by proximity and the number #
# of bonds each element is allowed and  #
# the input file mol_info.mol.          #
#                                       #
# This has only been tested on          #
# pentacene (quite a simple mol) so     #
# rely on it for more complex molecules #
# it may need expanding.                #

# Set some variables
folder = "./examples/data"
filepath = "$folder/monomer.xyz"
this_files_folder = "examples/create_psf_file_from_xyz"

# Read the xyz file
read $filepath xyz as mol
# Tell the code we are using pentacene
set system mol to pentacene
# Read the parameter file
read "$this_files_folder/mol_info.mol" params as mol_prms
# Set the parameters for calculating the angles, bonds, dihedrals etc..
set params mol to mol_prms

# Actually get the psf data
calc psf_file from mol as psf

# Write the psf file
write psf "test.psf"
