# Will try and find molecular layers in a structure #
# The algorithm works by aligning the z axis of the #
# whole structure along the standard long axis      #
# (this is calculated from the peak of a histogram  #
# of the long axis vectors). A window is then       #
# scanned along the z axis of the rotated structure #
# and the number of atoms are counted within this   #
# window. The layers are defined by the troughs in  #
# the resulting distribution.                       #

set system pos to pentacene

# Actually calculate where the layers appear
calc mol_layers from pos as layers
